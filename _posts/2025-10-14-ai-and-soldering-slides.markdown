We had two awesome talks at the October meeting about Agentic Hacking and Soldering. Below is the run down on each for anyone who missed it.

## Agentic Hacking in VS Code
amne51ac reprised their talk about agentic hacking in VS Code that they gave at [SecretCon](https://www.secretcon.com/presentations/your-shell-has-a-sidekick-using-ai-to-supercharge-recon-research-and-exploitation) this year and walked us all through setting up RooCode to do some realtime hacking with AI as our copilot. 

A couple things to remember when following along with the [blog post](https://hackersidekick.com/turbo-charge-vs-code-with-roo-code.html) on the HackerSidekick website: 
* Set the temperature to exactly 1.0 by going into RooCode's advanced settings and setting a Custom Temperature
* Remember to set the temperature for all modes, not just Architect
* Failure to set the temperature to exactly 1.0 will cause a 4XX error 

## Soldering
bran gave us a deep dive on soldering and how it works, why it works, and how to do it right. Their slides are available in [ODP format here]({% link /assets/posts/2025-10-14-ai-and-soldering-slides/Soldering-talk-dcg312-10-04-2025-final.odp %}). 

They also shared some cool videos on how soldering works and how modern fabrication facilities function:
