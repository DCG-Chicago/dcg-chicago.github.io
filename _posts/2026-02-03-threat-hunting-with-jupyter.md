We had an intrepid group of students this month for Micah's talk on Threat Hunting with Jupyter and Pandas. We learned a ton about how to use Taegis Magic in conjunction with Jupyter to build repeatable threat hunting processes that can be shared across an organization to more effectively spin up, share, and collaborate on threat hunting activities. A big thank you to Micah for presenting, and to everyone who came out to our first meeting of 2026!

Here's a bunch of great resources he shared during the walkthrough: 

* [Threat Hunting with Jupyter Notebooks from Secureworks](https://docs.taegis.secureworks.com/hunting/jupyter_notebooks/)
* [Threat Hunting on Taegis Tutorials](https://github.com/secureworks/taegis-threat-hunting-tutorials?tab=readme-ov-file)
* [Taegis SDK for Python](https://github.com/secureworks/taegis-sdk-python/blob/main/README.md)
* [Taegis Magic](https://github.com/secureworks/taegis-magic/tree/main/docs/jupyter)
